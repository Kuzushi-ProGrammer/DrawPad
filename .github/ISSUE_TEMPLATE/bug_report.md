**BEFORE SUBMITTING AN ISSUE**
-I'm using Python 3.7 so make sure that's installed properly
-Make sure you have all the libraries installed so that the problems aren't arising from lack of libraries.

-Pillow (9.0.1)
-Pygame (2.1.2)
If you don't have these the program WILL NOT WORK as the majority of my code is pygame / pillow based
