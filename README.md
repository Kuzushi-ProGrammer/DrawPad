# DrawPad

# ---- Personal Project --- #
This is my own special personal project I made using python and some other modules like pygame.

I'm kind of sharing this here because I think it's really cool that I can share my stuff like this between computers and I also want to show some people too!

**Current build is stable. I'm probably not going to update this in the future, but it was a fun little project!**

First release is out! Have fun drawing! Instructions are on the GitHub Wiki page!

Some sample images are in the folder titled "Sample Images"

Images get saved to the "Exports" folder

**Make sure you have these things installed:**
- Python 3.8.8 
- Pygame 2.1.2 
- Pillow 9.0.1 
- Pygame-Menu 4.2.7 

# ---- Instructions ---- #
1. Install python from https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-388/
2. Make sure you have python installed properly by running 'python' in the command prompt (If not reinstalling all versions of python can help)
3. Run the command "py -m pip install --upgrade pip" (Without the quotes) in the command prompt
4. After pip is installed run the following commands:
  - pip install pygame
  - pip install Pillow
  - pip install pygame-menu
5. There you go it should be working now!
