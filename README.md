# DrawingTest

# ---- Personal Project --- #
This is my own special personal project i'm making using python and some other libraries like pygame.

I'm kind of sharing this here because I think it's really cool that I can share my stuff like this between computers and I also want to show some people too!

Libraries in use:
- Pygame: https://www.pygame.org/docs/
- PIL (Pillow): https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/

Modules in use:
- Pygame (2.1.2)
- Pillow (9.0.1)
- Keyboard (0.13.5)

Oh also if there's any 'innapropriate' images in there that's just me screwing around and I accidentally left them in there and am too lazy to get them out *or* left them in cause they look cool ^^
