# DrawingTest

# ---- Personal Project --- #
This is my own special personal project i'm making using python and some other modules like pygame.

I'm kind of sharing this here because I think it's really cool that I can share my stuff like this between computers and I also want to show some people too!

**Current build is not very finished right now, it could have some bugs or just straight up not work.**

First release may come very soon, I'm adding some more features right now that will make the program actually usable.

Modules in use:
- Pygame (2.1.2) https://www.pygame.org/docs/
- Pillow (9.0.1) https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/
- Pygame-Menu (4.2.6) https://pygame-menu.readthedocs.io/en/4.2.6/#

Oh also if there's any 'innapropriate' images in there that's just me screwing around and I accidentally left them in there and am too lazy to get them out *or* left them in cause they look cool ^^

On a little bit of a haitus right now, burnout for this project setting in and i might just release as is once everything works properly
