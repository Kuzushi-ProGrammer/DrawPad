# DrawingTest

# ---- Personal Project --- #
This is my own special personal project I made using python and some other modules like pygame.

I'm kind of sharing this here because I think it's really cool that I can share my stuff like this between computers and I also want to show some people too!

**Current build is stable. I'm probably not going to update this in the future, but it was a fun little project!**

First release is out! Have fun drawing! Instructions are on the GitHub Wiki page!

Modules in use:
- Pygame (2.1.2) https://www.pygame.org/docs/
- Pillow (9.0.1) https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/
- Pygame-Menu (4.2.7) https://pygame-menu.readthedocs.io/en/4.2.7/#

Some sample images are in the folder titled "Sample Images"
