# DrawPad

# ---- Personal Project --- #
This is my own special personal project I made using python and some other modules like pygame.

I'm kind of sharing this here because I think it's really cool that I can share my stuff like this between computers and I also want to show some people too!

**Current build is stable. I'm probably not going to update this in the future, but it was a fun little project!**

First release is out! Have fun drawing! Instructions are on the GitHub Wiki page!

Some sample images are in the folder titled "Sample Images"

Images get saved to the "Exports" folder

**Make sure you have these things installed:**
- Python 3.8.8 (https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-388/)
- Pygame 2.1.2 (https://pypi.org/project/pygame/)
- Pillow 9.0.1 (https://pypi.org/project/Pillow/)
- Pygame-Menu 4.2.7 (https://pypi.org/project/pygame-menu/)

To install those you're gonna want to have pip as well:
https://pypi.org/project/pip/

I'm not 100% sure if you have to have all of them installed but python and pygame for sure :>
